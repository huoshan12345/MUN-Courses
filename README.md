# MUN-Courses (Markdown Edition)

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> Unofficial personal study notes.

This repository contains my Markdown rewrites of course slides and assignments that were originally provided in PDF format.

## Why this repository exists

Text in PDF files is often difficult to copy and reuse. Converting course materials to Markdown makes the content easier to copy, edit, and reference, especially in AI-assisted study workflows.

## Repository structure

- `ENGI-9867(Adv Comp Concepts for Engi)/`: Rewritten weekly notes and assignments in Markdown
- `symbols.md`: A collection of commonly used symbols for easy copy and paste

## Notes on figures and diagrams

Because Markdown is not ideal for embedding all original slide visuals, some images and diagrams are converted to text-based forms.

Example:
- A state transition diagram may be rewritten as a state transition expression.

## Accuracy and rendering notice

During rewriting, there may be occasional typing mistakes or rendering issues (for example, on GitHub web view or in Markdown preview editors).

If you find an issue, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Copyright & ownership notice

The original course materials (including slides, assignments, and their content) are the property of the course instructor and/or Memorial University.

This repository contains a personal Markdown reformatting for study convenience only. No copyright transfer is claimed.

If you are the rights holder and would like any content removed or modified, please open an issue or contact me, and I will address it promptly.

## Licensing

No open-source license is provided for the rewritten course-content files in this repository.
